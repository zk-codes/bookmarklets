# Bookmarklets Collection

A collection of useful JavaScript bookmarklets to enhance your web browsing experience.

## What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small JavaScript programs that can be stored as browser bookmarks. When clicked, they execute JavaScript code to enhance or modify the current webpage.

## Installation

To install a bookmarklet:

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser
2. Give it a name (e.g., "Color Inverter")
3. Instead of a URL, paste the entire JavaScript code provided
4. Save the bookmark

Once installed, you can click on the bookmark while visiting any webpage to execute the bookmarklet's functionality.

## Available Bookmarklets

### Color Inverter
Toggles a dark/light mode on any webpage by inverting colors. Images and videos remain in their original colors.
